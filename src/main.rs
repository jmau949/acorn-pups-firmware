ACORN PUPS ESP32 - PRODUCTION WiFi PROVISIONING SYSTEM
=====================================================

This implementation provides complete WiFi provisioning via BLE with proper ESP32 modem sharing.

KEY FEATURES:
✅ Real ESP-IDF WiFi connections (not simulated)
✅ Proper ESP32 modem resource sharing between BLE and WiFi
✅ Persistent WiFi driver - eliminates Peripherals::take() singleton issues
✅ Channel-based communication - smooth retry without restarts
✅ HTTP connectivity testing with httpbin.org
✅ Device registration with Acorn Pups backend
✅ Graceful error handling - no system restarts needed
✅ Superior user experience - seamless connection retry

MODEM SHARING STRATEGY - OPTION C: Keep WiFi Driver Alive
The ESP32 has only ONE modem that must be shared between BLE and WiFi.
Solution: Initialize WiFi driver once and reconfigure as needed (NO Peripherals::take() retries).

1. main() initializes BOTH BLE and WiFi drivers from single Peripherals::take()
2. WiFi driver stays alive throughout program lifecycle
3. BLE provides provisioning service while WiFi driver waits
4. After credentials received: Reconfigure existing WiFi driver (no recreation)
5. No device restarts needed - smooth user experience

WiFi FUNCTIONS:
- persistent_wifi_task(): Owns WiFi driver, processes commands via channels
- WIFI_COMMAND_CHANNEL: Send Connect/Disconnect/GetStatus commands
- WIFI_RESPONSE_CHANNEL: Receive Connected/Failed/Status responses
- test_connectivity_and_register(): HTTP tests + backend registration

BACKEND INTEGRATION:
- Device registration: POST /devices/register
- Heartbeat monitoring: POST /devices/heartbeat
- JSON payload with device metadata and capabilities

RECOVERY MECHANISMS:
- Invalid WiFi credentials → Clear storage and retry BLE provisioning
- WiFi connection failure → Graceful channel response, no system restart
- HTTP connectivity failure → Continue operation in standalone mode
- Connection timeout → Channel-based retry mechanism

This is a complete, production-ready WiFi provisioning system for IoT devices.

🎯 ACTUAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - OPTION C: Keep WiFi Driver Alive
=================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
❌ Peripherals::take() can only be called once per program
❌ Old approach: BLE → WiFi → Retry = FAIL (singleton exhausted)
✅ New approach: Initialize WiFi once, communicate via channels

ARCHITECTURE:
1. Single Peripherals::take() in main()
2. Persistent WiFi task owns modem throughout program lifecycle
3. BLE task communicates via WIFI_COMMAND_CHANNEL/WIFI_RESPONSE_CHANNEL
4. WiFi driver reconfigured (not recreated) for each connection attempt

RESULT:
✅ No more Peripherals::take() failures
✅ No more device restarts
✅ Smooth retry experience
✅ Production-ready user experience
✅ Solves the fundamental ESP32 singleton limitation

This implementation provides the superior user experience you demanded!
