[0mThis error occurs when a method is used on a type which doesn't implement it:[0m

[0mErroneous code example:[0m

[0m[0m[2mstruct Mouth;

let x = Mouth;
x.chocolate(); // error: no method named `chocolate` found for type `Mouth`
               //        in the current scope[0m

[0mIn this case, you need to implement the [0m[0m[2mchocolate[0m method to fix the error:[0m

[0m[0m[2mstruct Mouth;

impl Mouth {
    fn chocolate(&self) { // We implement the `chocolate` method here.
        println!("Hmmm! I love chocolate!");
    }
}

let x = Mouth;
x.chocolate(); // ok![0m[0m
